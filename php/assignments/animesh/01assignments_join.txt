FROM Subjects
JOIN Scores ON Subjects.subject_id = Scores.subject_id
GROUP BY Subjects.subject_id
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Retrieve the total number of students enrolled in each subject.

===>SELECT Subjects.subject_name, COUNT(DISTINCT Scores.student_id) AS students
FROM Subjects
JOIN Scores ON Subjects.subject_id = Scores.subject_id
GROUP BY Subjects.subject_id
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Find the subject with the highest average marks scored.

===>
SELECT sb.subject_name,sc.marks, avg(sc.marks) avg_marks
from subjects sb
join scores sc on sb.subject_id=sc.subject_id
group by sb.subject_id
order by avg_marks asc limit 0,1;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Retrieve the highest marks obtained in each subject.

===> SELECT Subjects.subject_name, MAX(Scores.marks) AS highest_marks
FROM Subjects
JOIN Scores ON Subjects.subject_id = Scores.subject_id
GROUP BY Subjects.subject_id

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Questions Based on HAVING
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. List the names of students who scored more than 80 marks in any subject (after grouping).

GROUP BY Students.student_id
HAVING MAX(Scores.marks) > 80
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Identify students who scored more than 200 marks across all subjects combined.

===>SELECT Students.name AS student_name, SUM(Scores.marks) AS total_marks
FROM Students
JOIN Scores ON Students.student_id = Scores.student_id
GROUP BY Students.student_id
HAVING total_marks > 200
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. List all the subjects in which at least one student scored below 40.
